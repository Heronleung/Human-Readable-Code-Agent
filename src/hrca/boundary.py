"""Headless local application boundary (P3.1).

The boundary is the single place that turns a versioned desktop-to-core request
into the deterministic read-only pipeline. It:

* reads newline-delimited JSON requests from stdin,
* validates each request and rejects unknown contract versions and
  non-allowlisted actions with bounded, sanitized errors,
* invokes only the existing task intake (:mod:`hrca.planning`), planner,
  scanner (:mod:`hrca.scanner`) and report builder (:mod:`hrca.report`),
* writes exactly one JSON response line per request to stdout.

The boundary is a review and safety *workflow* boundary, not an
operating-system privilege boundary: it owns contract validation, action
allowlisting, orchestration of the deterministic core, and bounded error
mapping — but it performs no repository write, Git operation, command
execution, network access, or provider call.

Stdio discipline: stdin and stdout are reconfigured to UTF-8 with newline
``"\\n"``, messages are serialized with ``ensure_ascii=True``, stdout is
reserved exclusively for protocol messages, and every log or diagnostic (there
are none in normal operation) goes to stderr.

"""Qt-free client supervision logic (P3.1).

The deterministic, testable half of the PySide6 client. It depends only on the
standard library and :mod:`hrca.contract` — it never imports the scanner,
planner, report builder, provider protocol, Git tooling, or any
command-execution code, and it never decides that an action is permitted.

It provides:

* ``LineBuffer`` — incremental accumulation of backend stdout into
  newline-delimited lines, with a maximum-message-size guard,
* ``ResponseRouter`` — correlation-id matching so stale responses are
  discarded and abandoned requests are marked blocked rather than failed,
* ``build_fixture_task`` — the fixed, read-only task the client submits,
* ``resolve_backend_command`` — the documented source/frozen launch rule,
* bounded client-side state labels.

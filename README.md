# Human-Readable Code Agent

A deterministic static scanner for Python source trees — the **Phase 1
baseline** for a "code twin" project. It parses Python with the standard-library
[`ast`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html) module and emits canonical
JSON records that later phases can turn into a navigable, twin-like
representation of the code.

This is **not** an IDE, an LLM agent, or a general-purpose analysis tool. It is
a small, bounded foundation: it extracts structure and emits only what the
source actually says.

## Setup (uv)

Requires Python 3.9+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
uv sync
```

`uv sync` creates or refreshes the project `.venv` and installs the project
(editable) with its dependencies from `uv.lock`.

> **Why not `pip`?** On many managed Python distributions, `pip install` into
> the system interpreter is blocked by
> [PEP 668](https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/) ("externally-managed-
> environment"). Use `uv` (or an explicit virtualenv) instead — never pass
> `--break-system-packages`.

There are no runtime dependencies — the parser baseline is the standard
library.

## Usage

```bash
uv run python -m hrca fixtures      # scan the fixture corpus
uv run hrca-scan fixtures           # equivalent, via console script
```

Output is canonical JSON on stdout (indented, keys sorted, records sorted).

## Test

```bash
uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The suite runs with the standard-library `unittest` runner only (no pytest
required).

## Record schema

The scanner emits a single JSON document with these top-level arrays:

| Key             | Contents                                                        |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `files`         | one record per scanned `.py` file (`path`, `module`, `syntax_status`) |
| `symbols`       | modules, classes, functions, async functions, parameters, variables |
| `relations`     | `imports`, `calls`, `returns`, `raises`, `inherits`             |
| `parse_errors`  | per-file `SyntaxError` records (the scan continues)             |
| `confidence`    | explicit states for items below `high` confidence               |

Symbols carry a `source_range` (`lineno`/`col_offset`/`end_lineno`/
`end_col_offset`) and are identified by stable dotted IDs such as
`app.service.Service.handle`. Relations carry the literal `target` name as
written in source, plus a `status` (`resolved` / `unresolved` / `recorded`).

## Scope and limitations

Determinism and no-fabrication are the core guarantees:

- **No name resolution.** A `target` is the literal name in the source; the
  scanner never resolves it to a definition or a file path, so it cannot
  invent call edges or import targets.
- **Dynamic imports stay unresolved.** `importlib.import_module(...)` and
  `__import__(...)` are emitted as `imports` relations with `status:
  "unresolved"` and `confidence: "low"` (target is `null` unless the argument
  is a string literal). Reflection, dependency injection, and monkey-patching
  are similarly out of scope and are never guessed.
- **Syntax errors do not stop the scan.** A file that fails to parse yields a
  `parse_error` record and no symbols; other files are still scanned.
- **Assignment scope.** Only `Name` assignment targets become `variable`
  symbols; attribute assignments (e.g. `self.x = ...`) and function-local
  defaults are not modeled as named symbols.
- **Cross-version note.** Identifiers are stable across identical rescans in
  the same environment. Expression rendering uses `ast.unparse`, whose exact
  spelling can vary slightly between Python minor versions.

Out of scope entirely: LLM providers, semantic editing, UI, remote code
execution, multi-language support, and automated merges.
